# Zwift Routes

The Zwift Routes application (written for web, iOS, and Android) provides a listing of all the Zwift Routes available, together with whether you have completed them or not.  You can also filter the routes based on the world, sport, event, level, or whether you have completed the route.  This allows you to quickly determine the easiest or hardest route that is available today that you have yet to complete, making it easy to get all the route badges in Zwift.

## Cloud support

The whole point of this project is to enable them for cloud usage, including downloading the routes list and storing the completion state in the cloud.  This feature will be added later.
